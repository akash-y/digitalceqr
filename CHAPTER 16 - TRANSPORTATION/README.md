# Chapter 16 - Transportation
### [CEQR technical manual chapter 16](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/oec/technical-manual/16_Transportation_2014.pdf)
A positive effect on one mode of travel may
negatively impact another, while a negative effect on travel modes may negatively impact several aspects of the transportation
system. The objective of the transportation analyses is to determine whether a proposed project may have a
potential significant impact on traffic operations and mobility, public transportation facilities and services, pedestrian
elements and flow, safety of all roadway users (pedestrians, cyclists, transit users and motorists), on- and off-street
parking, or goods movement. 

Subjects to be considered in this analysis:
- **Mode of transportation**
- Challenge and determine basic assumptions: patterns seasonality? distance from subway
- **TRUCKS** > using SONYC data
- **Comulative effect** of future development 
- Comparison of **manufacturing and/or waterfront neighborhoods**

Data:
- PLUTO and MapPLUTO
- Census / ACS : age; **commuting patterns**
- SONYC data
