### [CEQR technical manual chapter 18](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/oec/technical-manual/18_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_2014.pdf)
Increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are changing the global climate, which is predicted to lead to wide-ranging
effects on the environment, including rising sea levels, increases in temperature, and changes in precipitation levels
and intensity. Although this is occurring on a global scale, the environmental effects of climate change are also likely to
be felt at the local level. I

Subjects to be considered in this analysis:
- Understanding **No-build** vs **No-action** vs **RWCDS**
- **types of buildings**
- **Sea level**
- **Comulative effect** of future development 
- Comparing **manufacturing and/or waterfront neighborhoods**

Data:
- PLUTO and MapPLUTO
- Schools
- NYC Open Data: GHG emmissions 
- FEMA
