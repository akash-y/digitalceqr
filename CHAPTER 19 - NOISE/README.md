# Chapter 19 - Noise
### [CEQR technical manual chapter 19](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/oec/technical-manual/19_Noise_2014.pdf)
noise levels that are not
considered hazardous should not be overlooked since they can cause stress-related illnesses, disrupt sleep, and interrupt
activities requiring concentration. In New York City, with its high concentration of population and commercial activities,
such problems may be common.
This chapter discusses the topic of noise as it relates to regulations and guidelines that govern activities in New York
City. It defines technical terms, discusses the appropriateness of a noise analysis, and provides information related to
study area definitions, technical subareas, models, and detailed noise analysis techniques.
